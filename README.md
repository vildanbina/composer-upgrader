## 🎮 Commands

### `upgrade-all`

Upgrade your dependencies with ease. This command modifies `composer.json` and prompts you to run `composer update` to apply the changes.

**Usage:**

~~~bash
composer upgrade-all [options]
~~~

#### Options:
- **`--major`**: Upgrade to the latest major versions (e.g., `1.0.0` → `2.0.0`). Enabled by default.
- **`--minor`**: Upgrade to the latest minor versions (e.g., `1.0.0` → `1.1.0`). Enabled by default.
- **`--patch`**: Upgrade to the latest patch versions (e.g., `1.0.0` → `1.0.1`). Enabled by default.
- **`--dry-run`**: Preview upgrades without modifying files.
- **`--stability <level>`**: Set minimum stability (`stable`, `beta`, `alpha`, `dev`). Defaults to `stable`.
- **`--only <packages>`**: Upgrade specific packages (e.g., `vendor/package1,vendor/package2`).

#### Examples:

- **Patch-Only Upgrade:**
  ~~~bash
  composer upgrade-all --patch
  ~~~
  Output:
  ~~~
  Fetching latest package versions...
  Found vendor/package: ^1.0.0 -> 1.0.1
