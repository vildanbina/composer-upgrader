## ðŸ“¦ Installation

You can install Composer Upgrader either **locally** in your project or **globally** on your system:

### Local Installation
Add it to your project:

~~~bash
composer require vildanbina/composer-upgrader
~~~

### Global Installation

> **Note**: Ensure your global Composer bin directory (e.g., `~/.composer/vendor/bin` or `~/.config/composer/vendor/bin`) is in your PATH to run `composer upgrade-all` from anywhere. Check with `echo $PATH` and update if needed (e.g., `export PATH="$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin:$PATH"`).

No additional setup requiredâ€”ready to use either way!

## Commands

### `upgrade-all`

Upgrade your project dependencies with ease. This command scans your `composer.json`, updates it with the latest compatible versions, and advises you to run `composer update` to apply the changes.

**Usage:**

~~~bash
composer upgrade-all [options]
~~~

#### Options:
- **`--major`**: Upgrade to the latest major versions (e.g., `1.0.0` â†’ `2.0.0`). Enabled by default.
- **`--minor`**: Upgrade to the latest minor versions (e.g., `1.0.0` â†’ `1.1.0`). Enabled by default.
- **`--patch`**: Upgrade to the latest patch versions (e.g., `1.0.0` â†’ `1.0.1`). Enabled by default.
- **`--dry-run`**: Preview upgrades without modifying filesâ€”ideal for testing.
- **`--stability <level>`**: Set minimum stability (`stable`, `beta`, `alpha`, `dev`). Defaults to `stable`.
- **`--only <packages>`**: Upgrade specific packages (e.g., `vendor/package1,vendor/package2`).

#### Examples:

- **Patch-Only Upgrade:**
  ~~~bash
  composer upgrade-all --patch
  ~~~
  **Output:**
  ~~~
  Fetching latest package versions...
  Found vendor/package: ^1.0.0 -> 1.0.1
  Composer.json has been updated. Please run "composer update" to apply changes.
  ~~~

- **Preview Major Upgrades:**
  ~~~bash
  composer upgrade-all --major --dry-run
  ~~~
  **Output:**
  ~~~
  Fetching latest package versions...
  Found vendor/package: ^1.0.0 -> 2.0.0
  Dry run complete. No changes applied.
  ~~~

- **Specific Packages:**
  ~~~bash
  composer upgrade-all --only vendor/package1 --patch
  ~~~
  **Output:**
  ~~~
  Fetching latest package versions...
  Found vendor/package1: ^1.0.0 -> 1.0.1
  Composer.json has been updated. Please run "composer update" to apply changes.
  ~~~

After running, finalize the updates with:
